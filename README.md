Firstly, I created a project for analyzing and visualizing supermarket sales data using Python.

I used libraries like pandas for data processing and matplotlib for plotting charts.

The project reads sales data from a CSV file that contains columns like Order Date, Ship Date, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, etc.

I grouped the data by Category and Sub-Category and calculated the sum of Sales to get insights about sales performance.

I visualized the grouped data using bar charts and line plots to show trends and comparisons between categories and sub-categories.

Finally, this project helps to understand which product categories are performing well and can be extended further with additional analysis or dashboards.
